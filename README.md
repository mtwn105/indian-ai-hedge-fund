# Indian AI Hedge Fund

## Overview

This project implements a command-line AI-powered portfolio analysis tool focused on the Indian stock market, specifically using Zerodha Kite integration. Users can select different AI "analysts" (powered by LLMs like OpenAI or Google AI via Langchain/LangGraph) to review their current holdings. The tool fetches holdings via the Kite Connect API and applies the chosen analysis strategies, presenting the results in the terminal.

## Features

- Connects to Zerodha Kite to fetch user portfolio holdings.
- Interactive selection of different AI analyst agents for portfolio review.
- Utilizes Large Language Models (OpenAI, Google AI) via Langchain and LangGraph for analysis.
- Extensible analyst framework (add new analysis strategies in `src/indian_ai_hedge_fund/analysts`).
- Structured tool usage for API calls (e.g., fetching holdings).
- Rich terminal output for progress and results.
- Configuration via `.env` file.

## Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.11
- Poetry (https://python-poetry.org/)
- A Zerodha Kite developer account and API credentials.
- API Keys for desired Large Language Models (e.g., OpenAI, Google AI).

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/indian-ai-hedge-fund.git
    cd indian-ai-hedge-fund
    ```

2.  Install dependencies using Poetry:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

## Configuration

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying `.env.example` (if it exists) or creating it manually.
2.  Add your API keys and configuration:

    ```dotenv
    # Zerodha Kite API Credentials
    KITE_API_KEY="your_kite_api_key"
    KITE_API_SECRET="your_kite_secret"
    # Obtain this using the generate_token script (see below)
    KITE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_kite_access_token"

    # LLM API Keys (add the ones you intend to use)
    # OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
    # GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"

    # Optional: Configure Logging
    # LOG_LEVEL="INFO" # e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
    ```

3.  **Generating Kite Access Token**: The `KITE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is short-lived. You may need to generate it daily using Zerodha's process. This project might include a helper script (check `src/indian_ai_hedge_fund/utils/generate_token.py` if available) or you might need to run a manual flow. Example using a potential script:
    ```bash
    poetry run python src/indian_ai_hedge_fund/utils/generate_token.py
    ```
    Follow the instructions (likely involving logging into Kite and redirecting) and copy the obtained access token into your `.env` file.

## Usage

1.  Ensure your `.env` file is correctly configured with API keys and a valid `KITE_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
2.  Run the main application:

    ```bash
    poetry run python src/indian_ai_hedge_fund/main.py
    ```

3.  Follow the interactive prompts in your terminal to select the desired AI analysts.
4.  The tool will fetch holdings, perform analysis, and display results in the terminal.
